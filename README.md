# Internship Projects (Summer 2025)

This repository showcases the various projects I worked on during my internship at *Logesys* in Summer 2025. Throughout these projects, I gained hands-on experience with cutting-edge technologies, including generative and agentic AI, cloud computing, and data analysis tools. Below, you can find detailed descriptions of the projects I contributed to:

---

## 1. Auto Insights

**Overview**:  
The **Auto Insights** project was the primary focus of my internship. I developed a chatbot designed to connect to SQL or PowerBI databases and provide intelligent insights from large datasets. The chatbot can deliver key performance metrics, evaluate sales, regional, or product performance, and generate insightful charts to visualize data. My implementation with Google Gemini gave 60% faster responses, had a 25% cost reduction, and had higher response quality and reliability, with a 30% higher success rate than before. I worked with the product team to migrate Auto Insights to GCP, and bring my implementation into production, handling clients with vast global business data.

**Key Features**:
- **Streamlit interface** for chat session management, event logging, and displaying text, charts, and tables.
- Integration with **MSSQL, MySQL**, and **PowerBI** for backend data management.
- Use of **VertexAI Agent Engine** for session management, memory, authentication, and agent workflows.
- API design and testing with **Postman** to provide access, authentication
- The bot provides data-driven insights and visualizations that can be used for better business decision-making.

**Technologies Used**:  
Python, HTML, CSS, Streamlit, MSSQL, MySQL, PowerBI, VertexAI, GCP, Pinecone RAG, Postman, APIs

**Lessons Learned**:  
Working on this project revealed the power of agentic AI and its potential in business analytics. I learned how to integrate complex systems and leverage diverse tools to extract actionable insights from data. Moreover, I learned how to collaborate on software development to bring an idea into production, handling scalability, security, reliability, and efficiency.

## 2. DSPy – Optimized Prompt Engineering

**Overview**:  
I worked with **DSPy**, a powerful library designed to improve prompt engineering through structured coding. This tool allows for the creation of tailored, optimized prompts for machine learning models, offering advanced features like history management and output customization.

**Key Features**:
- **Robust prompt engineering** with structured coding instead of natural language.
- **Structured output** providing ability to reliably generate various formats of LLM output, like text, charts, tables, images, etc.

**Technologies Used**:  
DSPy, Python

**Lessons Learned**:  
I discovered how optimizing prompts can make machine learning models significantly more efficient. The integration with **MLFlow** and fine-tuning the model provided deep insights into the inner workings of AI systems.

**Further Learning**
This library really fascinated me, and I am currently working on integrating it with MLFlow for reasoning and action visualization. I also am working on using the MIPROv2 optimizer to fine-tune the model to generate better results for my specific use case.

## 3. AWS Projects – Cloud Computing POCs

**Overview**:  
In this collection of smaller projects, I worked with **AWS cloud services** to build Proofs of Concept (POCs) ranging from basic cloud computing concepts to more advanced projects like Bedrock agents.

**Key Features**:
- Developed **Lambda functions** and **API Gateway** to create applications such as a BMI calculator, file uploader, and an S3 portal.
- Used **Streamlit** to build user-friendly interfaces for all projects.
- Integrated **AWS MySQL** and **MongoDB** with **Lambda** for data extraction and manipulation.

**Technologies Used**:  
AWS EC2, Lambda, API Gateway, S3, MySQL, MongoDB, Streamlit

**Lessons Learned**:  
I gained a solid understanding of cloud computing, working with Lambda functions, API Gateway, and S3. Learning AWS helped me grasp the scale and flexibility of cloud architectures and how to integrate them into real-world applications.

## 4. Other Notable Experiences

During my internship, I also had the opportunity to collaborate with the product team, conduct research on various platforms for generative and agentic AI, and participate in various workshops that helped me strengthen my skills in software development, data analysis, and AI engineering. These experiences have contributed greatly to my technical growth and problem-solving abilities.

I now feel confident working with agentic AI applications, using Python for full stack deployment, working with cloud computing architecture for access and scalability, integrating SQL and non-relational database backends, and creating software products business analytics. Moreover, I have gained valuable experience working with a tight-knit product development team, and learning new software and AI concepts in a fast-paced startup environment.

**Tools used**
- N8N, DSPy, Streamlit, MySQL, MongoDB, PowerBI, AWS (EC2, Lambda, S3, API Gateway, Bedrock), Postman, GCP (Buckets, Agent Engine, VertexAI)
