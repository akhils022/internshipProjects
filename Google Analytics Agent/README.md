This is an implementation of a business analytics chatbot, called AutoReports,
using agentic AI with the Google ADK framework. It can upload provided text/pdf files to 
a document corpora with vector embeddings, where it can utilize Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
to provide a well informed answer to queries. It can also add CSV files to an SQL database, which
it can then query to analayze business data and visualize trends using Highcharts graphs.
It is fully agentic, and can convert natural language into SQL queries, and works with multiple
tables and corpora.
