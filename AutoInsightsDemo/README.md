# Auto Insights

## Overview

The **Auto Insights** project is an AI-driven chatbot designed to provide intelligent data insights by connecting to SQL databases and/or PowerBI. The chatbot can analyze and visualize large datasets, offering key performance metrics, sales evaluations, regional performance, and product analysis. By implementing Google Gemini, this project achieved 60% faster responses, a 25% reduction in costs, and a 30% higher success rate in comparison to previous iterations. The chatbot interface allows easy interaction and provides actionable insights that can be used to make informed business decisions.

During the internship, I collaborated with the product team to migrate Auto Insights to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and bring the implementation into production, ensuring the system could handle clients with vast amounts of global business data securely and reliably.
